the lord give mercy unto the house of onesiphorus ; for he oft refreshed me , and was not ashamed of my chain .
now i say that jesus christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of god , to confirm the promises made unto the fathers .

and the first day of unleavened bread , when they killed the passover , his disciples said unto him , where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover ?

then jesus answering said unto them , go your way , and tell john what things ye have seen and heard ; how that the blind see , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , to the poor the gospel is preached .
thou therefore endure hardness , as a good soldier of jesus christ .
thou that makest thy boast of the law , through breaking the law dishonourest thou god ?

destruction and misery are in their ways .
to titus , mine own son after the common faith : grace , mercy , and peace , from god the father and the lord jesus christ our saviour .
and when i come , whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters , them will i send to bring your liberality unto jerusalem .

forbearing one another , and forgiving one another , if any man have a quarrel against any : even as christ forgave you , so also do ye .
whom jason hath received : and these all do contrary to the decrees of caesar , saying that there is another king , one jesus .

make you perfect in every good work to do his will , working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight , through jesus christ ; to whom be glory for ever and ever . amen .
and they immediately left the ship and their father , and followed him .
truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers : for they indeed killed them , and ye build their sepulchres .
till i make thine enemies thy footstool .
the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit , that we are the children of god .
but he that doeth truth cometh to the light , that his deeds may be made manifest , that they are wrought in god .
and zacchaeus stood , and said unto the lord ; behold , lord , the half of my goods i give to the poor ; and if i have taken any thing from any man by false accusation , i restore him fourfold .
the jews then murmured at him , because he said , i am the bread which came down from heaven .
now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour .
but the rich , in that he is made low : because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away .
and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished , as many as came with peter , because that on the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy ghost .
came behind him , and touched the border of his garment : and immediately her issue of blood stanched .
your gold and silver is cankered ; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you , and shall eat your flesh as it were fire . ye have heaped treasure together for the last days .

for he looked for a city which hath foundations , whose builder and maker is god .
and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves , who is this that forgiveth sins also ?
why do ye not understand my speech ? even because ye cannot hear my word .
and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant , and to the blood of sprinkling , that speaketh better things than that of abel .
and whatsoever ye do , do it heartily , as to the lord , and not unto men .
and there was one named barabbas , which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him , who had committed murder in the insurrection .
but jesus perceived their wickedness , and said , why tempt ye me , ye hypocrites ?
how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed ? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher ?
there is a lad here , which hath five barley loaves , and two small fishes : but what are they among so many ?
who appeared in glory , and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at jerusalem .

then answered peter and said unto him , behold , we have forsaken all , and followed thee ; what shall we have therefore ?
for even when we were with you , this we commanded you , that if any would not work , neither should he eat .
and even things without life giving sound , whether pipe or harp , except they give a distinction in the sounds , how shall it be known what is piped or harped ?
and the jews ' passover was at hand , and jesus went up to jerusalem .
that ye submit yourselves unto such , and to every one that helpeth with us , and laboureth .
it hath been said , whosoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorcement .
and when she saw him , she was troubled at his saying , and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be .

but contrariwise , when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me , as the gospel of the circumcision was unto peter .
then they went out to see what was done ; and came to jesus , and found the man , out of whom the devils were departed , sitting at the feet of jesus , clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
and now i am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and i come to thee . holy father , keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me , that they may be one , as we are .
therefore watch , and remember , that by the space of three years i ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears .
that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven : for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust .
and we have confidence in the lord touching you , that ye both do and will do the things which we command you .
then came one and told them , saying , behold , the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple , and teaching the people .
jesus saith unto them , come and dine . and none of the disciples durst ask him , who art thou ? knowing that it was the lord .
meats for the belly , and the belly for meats : but god shall destroy both it and them . now the body is not for fornication , but for the lord ; and the lord for the body .
but jesus called them unto him , and said , suffer little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of god .
and jesus answering said unto him , suffer it to be so now : for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness . then he suffered him .
for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law : and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law .
wherefore when we could no longer forbear , we thought it good to be left at athens alone .
and he shall send jesus christ , which before was preached unto you .
and these all , having obtained a good report through faith , received not the promise .
for this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . and they began to be merry .
and jesus stood still , and called them , and said , what will ye that i shall do unto you ?
to whom we gave place by subjection , no , not for an hour ; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you .
for many are called , but few are chosen .
and with many such parables spake he the word unto them , as they were able to hear it .
for they were about five thousand men . and he said to his disciples , make them sit down by fifties in a company .
and that he was buried , and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures .
unto whom it was revealed , that not unto themselves , but unto us they did minister the things , which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven ; which things the angels desire to look into .
and not as it was by one that sinned , so is the gift : for the judgment was by one to condemnation , but the free gift is of many offences unto justification .
but i say unto you , that elias is come already , and they knew him not , but have done unto him whatsoever they listed . likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them .
and when they found him not , they turned back again to jerusalem , seeking him .
then had the churches rest throughout all judaea and galilee and samaria , and were edified ; and walking in the fear of the lord , and in the comfort of the holy ghost , were multiplied .
for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost .
and one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink , saying , let alone ; let us see whether elias will come to take him down .
and he took it down , and wrapped it in linen , and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone , wherein never man before was laid .
or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding , that by my voice i might teach others also , than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue .
christ is become of no effect unto you , whosoever of you are justified by the law ; ye are fallen from grace .
that no flesh should glory in his presence .
know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ? so run , that ye may obtain .
then came to jesus scribes and pharisees , which were of jerusalem , saying .
but ye say , whosoever shall say to his father or his mother , it is a gift , by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me .
and the multitudes that went before , and that followed , cried , saying , hosanna to the son of david : blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord ; hosanna in the highest .
knowing , brethren beloved , your election of god .
for where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am i in the midst of them .
which was the son of melea , which was the son of menan , which was the son of mattatha , which was the son of nathan , which was the son of david .
and they also , if they abide not still in unbelief , shall be graffed in : for god is able to graff them in again .
for if that first covenant had been faultless , then should no place have been sought for the second .
and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul : neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own ; but they had all things common .
where is the wise ? where is the scribe ? where is the disputer of this world ? hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart , having no necessity , but hath power over his own will , and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin , doeth well .
ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where i am , thither ye cannot come .
i say then , hath god cast away his people ? god forbid . for i also am an israelite , of the seed of abraham , of the tribe of benjamin .
for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three .
and he said unto them , he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
now the names of the twelve apostles are these ; the first , simon , who is called peter , and andrew his brother ; james the son of zebedee , and john his brother .
which also they did , and sent it to the elders by the hands of barnabas and saul .
but when the jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with envy , and spake against those things which were spoken by paul , contradicting and blaspheming .
and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven loaves , and gave thanks , and brake , and gave to his disciples to set before them ; and they did set them before the people .
then spake jesus again unto them , saying , i am the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life .
and they reasoned with themselves , saying , if we shall say , from heaven ; he will say , why then did ye not believe him ?
it is good neither to eat flesh , nor to drink wine , nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth , or is offended , or is made weak .
and they went out of the prison , and entered into the house of lydia : and when they had seen the brethren , they comforted them , and departed .
but sanctify the lord god in your hearts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear .
and that he died for all , that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves , but unto him which died for them , and rose again .
peace i leave with you , my peace i give unto you : not as the world giveth , give i unto you . let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt ; because they continued not in my covenant , and i regarded them not , saith the lord .
because it entereth not into his heart , but into the belly , and goeth out into the draught , purging all meats ?
then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane , and saith unto the disciples , sit ye here , while i go and pray yonder .
therefore i thought it necessary to exhort the brethren , that they would go before unto you , and make up beforehand your bounty , whereof ye had notice before , that the same might be ready , as a matter of bounty , and not as of covetousness .
and likewise a levite , when he was at the place , came and looked on him , and passed by on the other side .
( as it is written , he hath dispersed abroad ; he hath given to the poor : his righteousness remaineth for ever .
and peter , fastening his eyes upon him with john , said , look on us .
verily , verily , i say unto you , he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
fear not , little flock ; for it is your father ' s good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
but he answered and said , it is written , man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god .
what is my reward then ? verily that , when i preach the gospel , i may make the gospel of christ without charge , that i abuse not my power in the gospel .
for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth , there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins .
who , when they had examined me , would have let me go , because there was no cause of death in me .
and then shall they see the son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory .
and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works .
and i , brethren , when i came to you , came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom , declaring unto you the testimony of god .
for i long to see you , that i may impart unto you some spiritual gift , to the end ye may be established .
and many spread their garments in the way : and others cut down branches off the trees , and strawed them in the way .
then the jews sought him at the feast , and said , where is he ?
and lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil : for thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , for ever . amen .
said unto them , ye have brought this man unto me , as one that perverteth the people : and , behold , i , having examined him before you , have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him .
our fathers did eat manna in the desert ; as it is written , he gave them bread from heaven to eat .
and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . and he went into the pharisee ' s house , and sat down to meat .
erastus abode at corinth : but trophimus have i left at miletum sick .
and jesus answered and said unto her , martha , martha , thou art careful and troubled about many things .
and many resorted unto him , and said , john did no miracle : but all things that john spake of this man were true .
for finding fault with them , he saith , behold , the days come , saith the lord , when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah .
and such trust have we through christ to god - ward .

jesus answered them , verily , verily , i say unto you , whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin .
and he straitly charged him , and forthwith sent him away .
and it came to pass , that , while apollos was at corinth , paul having passed through the upper coasts came to ephesus : and finding certain disciples .
and jesus answering said unto them , do ye not therefore err , because ye know not the scriptures , neither the power of god ?
since we heard of your faith in christ jesus , and of the love which ye have to all the saints .
doth not behave itself unseemly , seeketh not her own , is not easily provoked , thinketh no evil .
then said pilate unto them , take ye him , and judge him according to your law . the jews therefore said unto him , it is not lawful for us to put any man to death .
and many of the people believed on him , and said , when christ cometh , will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done ?
martha saith unto him , i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day .
the enemy that sowed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are the angels .
but he denied before them all , saying , i know not what thou sayest .
and they asked him , saying , master , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , neither acceptest thou the person of any , but teachest the way of god truly .
but mary kept all these things , and pondered them in her heart .
for this is the word of promise , at this time will i come , and sara shall have a son .
for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe , of which no man gave attendance at the altar .
and immediately he arose , took up the bed , and went forth before them all ; insomuch that they were all amazed , and glorified god , saying , we never saw it on this fashion .
but if ye be without chastisement , whereof all are partakers , then are ye bastards , and not sons .
wherefore , my brethren , when ye come together to eat , tarry one for another .
and the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates : and they feared , when they heard that they were romans .
and as he entered into a certain village , there met him ten men that were lepers , which stood afar off .
but to do good and to communicate forget not : for with such sacrifices god is well pleased .
and at even , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all that were diseased , and them that were possessed with devils .
but now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which i have heard of god : this did not abraham .
peter seeing him saith to jesus , lord , and what shall this man do ?
( for the children being not yet born , neither having done any good or evil , that the purpose of god according to election might stand , not of works , but of him that calleth ; )
and i , brethren , could not speak unto you as unto spiritual , but as unto carnal , even as unto babes in christ .
but let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of that bread , and drink of that cup .
but this man , after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , sat down on the right hand of god .
and then will i profess unto them , i never knew you : depart from me , ye that work iniquity .
shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant , even as i had pity on thee ?
but jesus beheld them , and said unto them , with men this is impossible ; but with god all things are possible .
yet count him not as an enemy , but admonish him as a brother .
jesus answered , i have not a devil ; but i honour my father , and ye do dishonour me .
and the passover , a feast of the jews , was nigh .
to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs , being seen of them forty days , and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god .
and he denied him , saying , woman , i know him not .
having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself , according to the good pleasure of his will .
wherefore god also hath highly exalted him , and given him a name which is above every name .
who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges ? who planteth a vineyard , and eateth not of the fruit thereof ? or who feedeth a flock , and eateth not of the milk of the flock ?
but whereunto shall i liken this generation ? it is like unto children sitting in the markets , and calling unto their fellows .
and it came to pass , when the time was come that he should be received up , he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem .
and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience , when your obedience is fulfilled .
i speak to your shame . is it so , that there is not a wise man among you ? no , not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren ?
neither can they die any more : for they are equal unto the angels ; and are the children of god , being the children of the resurrection .
i must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night cometh , when no man can work .
but jesus held his peace . and the high priest answered and said unto him , i adjure thee by the living god , that thou tell us whether thou be the christ , the son of god .
and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand , and caught him , and said unto him , o thou of little faith , wherefore didst thou doubt ?
then said he also to him that bade him , when thou makest a dinner or a supper , call not thy friends , nor thy brethren , neither thy kinsmen , nor thy rich neighbours ; lest they also bid thee again , and a recompence be made thee .
then came the first , saying , lord , thy pound hath gained ten pounds .
but when the husbandmen saw the son , they said among themselves , this is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and let us seize on his inheritance .
therefore being a prophet , and knowing that god had sworn with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his loins , according to the flesh , he would raise up christ to sit on his throne .
when jesus heard these things , he marvelled at him , and turned him about , and said unto the people that followed him , i say unto you , i have not found so great faith , no , not in israel .
and pilate , when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people .
and when he heard this , he was very sorrowful : for he was very rich .
wherefore , my brethren , ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ ; that ye should be married to another , even to him who is raised from the dead , that we should bring forth fruit unto god .
and he sent them to bethlehem , and said , go and search diligently for the young child ; and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that i may come and worship him also .
and jesus going up to jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way , and said unto them .
being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness , which causeth through us thanksgiving to god .
unto which promise our twelve tribes , instantly serving god day and night , hope to come . for which hope ' s sake , king agrippa , i am accused of the jews .
but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god , it is evident : for , the just shall live by faith .
for this cause i paul , the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles .
and he arose from thence , and cometh into the coasts of judaea by the farther side of jordan : and the people resort unto him again ; and , as he was wont , he taught them again .
then took they the body of jesus , and wound it in linen clothes with the spices , as the manner of the jews is to bury .
and they began to accuse him , saying , we found this fellow perverting the nation , and forbidding to give tribute to caesar , saying that he himself is christ a king .
art not thou that egyptian , which before these days madest an uproar , and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers ?
for after this manner in the old time the holy women also , who trusted in god , adorned themselves , being in subjection unto their own husbands .
and when they had crucified him , they parted his garments , casting lots upon them , what every man should take .
if ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but i have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you .
and he kneeled down , and cried with a loud voice , lord , lay not this sin to their charge . and when he had said this , he fell asleep .
and if christ be not raised , your faith is vain ; ye are yet in your sins .
and walk in love , as christ also hath loved us , and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweetsmelling savour .
and when there had been much disputing , peter rose up , and said unto them , men and brethren , ye know how that a good while ago god made choice among us , that the gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel , and believe .
for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death , we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection .
and some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him .
and if thy right eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
but he , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and a house divided against a house falleth .
there was a man sent from god , whose name was john .
the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before that great and notable day of the lord come .
and suddenly , when they had looked round about , they saw no man any more , save jesus only with themselves .
and he saith unto him , friend , how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment ? and he was speechless .
and not many days after the younger son gathered all together , and took his journey into a far country , and there wasted his substance with riotous living .
but seek ye first the kingdom of god , and his righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
when jesus came into the coasts of caesarea philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , whom do men say that i the son of man am ?

for ye may all prophesy one by one , that all may learn , and all may be comforted .
and one of you say unto them , depart in peace , be ye warmed and filled ; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body ; what doth it profit ?
but they shall proceed no further : for their folly shall be manifest unto all men , as theirs also was .
for they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you , and how ye turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god .
and this i do for the gospel ' s sake , that i might be partaker thereof with you .
and whosoever will be chief among you , let him be your servant .
but , lo , he speaketh boldly , and they say nothing unto him . do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ ?
and he spake many things unto them in parables , saying , behold , a sower went forth to sow .
and of his fulness have all we received , and grace for grace .
who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world , but was manifest in these last times for you .
and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost , and prophesied , saying .
then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the lord in the air : and so shall we ever be with the lord .

and all the men were about twelve .
greet ye one another with a kiss of charity . peace be with you all that are in christ jesus . amen .
to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever . amen .
and it came to pass afterward , that he went throughout every city and village , preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of god : and the twelve were with him .
for he longed after you all , and was full of heaviness , because that ye had heard that he had been sick .
and in nothing terrified by your adversaries : which is to them an evident token of perdition , but to you of salvation , and that of god .
he that despised moses ' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses .
now there were seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and dying left no seed .
for if the dead rise not , then is not christ raised .
then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat , and let her fall off .

but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all .
neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies , which minister questions , rather than godly edifying which is in faith : so do .
in the last day , that great day of the feast , jesus stood and cried , saying , if any man thirst , let him come unto me , and drink .

then judas , which betrayed him , answered and said , master , is it i ? he said unto him , thou hast said .
for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .

and after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them , saying , ye men and brethren , if ye have any word of exhortation for the people , say on .
but he said unto them , all men cannot receive this saying , save they to whom it is given .
and paul after this tarried there yet a good while , and then took his leave of the brethren , and sailed thence into syria , and with him priscilla and aquila ; having shorn his head in cenchrea : for he had a vow .
and a certain man lame from his mother ' s womb was carried , whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful , to ask alms of them that entered into the temple .
while he yet talked to the people , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , desiring to speak with him .
after they were come to mysia , they assayed to go into bithynia : but the spirit suffered them not .
whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow . for what is your life ? it is even a vapour , that appeareth for a little time , and then vanisheth away .

but when he heard that archelaus did reign in judaea in the room of his father herod , he was afraid to go thither : notwithstanding , being warned of god in a dream , he turned aside into the parts of galilee .
grace be to you and peace from god our father , and from the lord jesus christ .
and this word , yet once more , signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that are made , that those things which cannot be shaken may remain .
let him eschew evil , and do good ; let him seek peace , and ensue it .
and judas also , which betrayed him , knew the place : for jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples .
so they ran both together : and the other disciple did outrun peter , and came first to the sepulchre .
not purloining , but shewing all good fidelity ; that they may adorn the doctrine of god our saviour in all things .
now i beseech you , brethren , mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned ; and avoid them .
yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world , or with the covetous , or extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then must ye needs go out of the world .
for in many things we offend all . if any man offend not in word , the same is a perfect man , and able also to bridle the whole body .
but when thou makest a feast , call the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind .
i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord , i die daily .
even as they delivered them unto us , which from the beginning were eyewitnesses , and ministers of the word .
my brethren , have not the faith of our lord jesus christ , the lord of glory , with respect of persons .
for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing , nor uncircumcision , but a new creature .
and he said , how can i , except some man should guide me ? and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him .

jesus answered him , if i have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil : but if well , why smitest thou me ?
all these evil things come from within , and defile the man .
the aged women likewise , that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness , not false accusers , not given to much wine , teachers of good things .
for whosoever shall keep the whole law , and yet offend in one point , he is guilty of all .
but that it spread no further among the people , let us straitly threaten them , that they speak henceforth to no man in this name .
and i have declared unto them thy name , and will declare it : that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them , and i in them .
he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .

he that hath the bride is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom , which standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom ' s voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled .
women received their dead raised to life again : and others were tortured , not accepting deliverance ; that they might obtain a better resurrection .
and jesus went up into a mountain , and there he sat with his disciples .
are ye not then partial in yourselves , and are become judges of evil thoughts ?
also i say unto you , whosoever shall confess me before men , him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god .
peter therefore was kept in prison : but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him .
but the comforter , which is the holy ghost , whom the father will send in my name , he shall teach you all things , and bring all things to your remembrance , whatsoever i have said unto you .
verily i say unto you , whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child , he shall not enter therein .
take therefore no thought for the morrow : for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself . sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .
and when peter was come to himself , he said , now i know of a surety , that the lord hath sent his angel , and hath delivered me out of the hand of herod , and from all the expectation of the people of the jews .
for our exhortation was not of deceit , nor of uncleanness , nor in guile .
henceforth i call you not servants ; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth : but i have called you friends ; for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you .
then saul , ( who also is called paul , ) filled with the holy ghost , set his eyes on him .
and he that doubteth is damned if he eat , because he eateth not of faith : for whatsoever is not of faith is sin .

wherefore remember , that ye being in time past gentiles in the flesh , who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands .
but i say unto you , i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine , until that day when i drink it new with you in my father ' s kingdom .
then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john , to be baptized of him .
and when jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side , much people gathered unto him : and he was nigh unto the sea .
by the word of truth , by the power of god , by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left .
him that is weak in the faith receive ye , but not to doubtful disputations .
for the husband is the head of the wife , even as christ is the head of the church : and he is the saviour of the body .
and it was told him by certain which said , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to see thee .
and jesus answered and said unto them , i will also ask of you one question , and answer me , and i will tell you by what authority i do these things .
moreover when ye fast , be not , as the hypocrites , of a sad countenance : for they disfigure their faces , that they may appear unto men to fast . verily i say unto you , they have their reward .
and he said , come . and when peter was come down out of the ship , he walked on the water , to go to jesus .
so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed .
and the young men arose , wound him up , and carried him out , and buried him .
and thou shalt have joy and gladness ; and many shall rejoice at his birth .
the same day came to him the sadducees , which say that there is no resurrection , and asked him .
for with god nothing shall be impossible .
and that ye put on the new man , which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness .
and how i kept back nothing that was profitable unto you , but have shewed you , and have taught you publickly , and from house to house .
for if the truth of god hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory ; why yet am i also judged as a sinner ?
when they now shoot forth , ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand .
is the law then against the promises of god ? god forbid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , verily righteousness should have been by the law .
now about that time herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church .
there is nothing from without a man , that entering into him can defile him : but the things which come out of him , those are they that defile the man .

beware of false prophets , which come to you in sheep ' s clothing , but inwardly they are ravening wolves .
no man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment : else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old , and the rent is made worse .
for i also am a man set under authority , having under me soldiers , and i say unto one , go , and he goeth ; and to another , come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , do this , and he doeth it .
for we wrestle not against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this world , against spiritual wickedness in high places .
not with eyeservice , as menpleasers ; but as the servants of christ , doing the will of god from the heart .
give us this day our daily bread .
and he became very hungry , and would have eaten : but while they made ready , he fell into a trance .
and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham , which he had being yet uncircumcised .
greet all the brethren with an holy kiss .
my sheep hear my voice , and i know them , and they follow me .
concerning his son jesus christ our lord , which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh .
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death , and have crucified him .
then went this saying abroad among the brethren , that that disciple should not die : yet jesus said not unto him , he shall not die ; but , if i will that he tarry till i come , what is that to thee ?
and he began to teach them , that the son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders , and of the chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
and as it is appointed unto men once to die , but after this the judgment .
for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ .
to the one we are the savour of death unto death ; and to the other the savour of life unto life . and who is sufficient for these things ?

and when they wanted wine , the mother of jesus saith unto him , they have no wine .
and said unto his servants , this is john the baptist ; he is risen from the dead ; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .

then paul and barnabas waxed bold , and said , it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you : but seeing ye put it from you , and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life , lo , we turn to the gentiles .
tribulation and anguish , upon every soul of man that doeth evil , of the jew first , and also of the gentile .
for indeed he was sick nigh unto death : but god had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , lest i should have sorrow upon sorrow .
and when the messengers of john were departed , he began to speak unto the people concerning john , what went ye out into the wilderness for to see ? a reed shaken with the wind ?
thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter : for thy heart is not right in the sight of god .
for it is written , rejoice , thou barren that bearest not ; break forth and cry , thou that travailest not : for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband .
and he sendeth forth two of his disciples , and saith unto them , go ye into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him .
which knew me from the beginning , if they would testify , that after the most straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee .

for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that ye through his poverty might be rich .
for god hath not appointed us to wrath , but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ .
then herod , when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men , was exceeding wroth , and sent forth , and slew all the children that were in bethlehem , and in all the coasts thereof , from two years old and under , according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men .
when ye come together therefore into one place , this is not to eat the lord ' s supper .
now when the pharisee which had bidden him saw it , he spake within himself , saying , this man , if he were a prophet , would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him : for she is a sinner .
then fell she down straightway at his feet , and yielded up the ghost : and the young men came in , and found her dead , and , carrying her forth , buried her by her husband .
they answering said , john the baptist ; but some say , elias ; and others say , that one of the old prophets is risen again .
then saith jesus unto him , get thee hence , satan : for it is written , thou shalt worship the lord thy god , and him only shalt thou serve .

which sometime were disobedient , when once the longsuffering of god waited in the days of noah , while the ark was a preparing , wherein few , that is , eight souls were saved by water .
but he perceived their craftiness , and said unto them , why tempt ye me ?
then simon peter answered him , lord , to whom shall we go ? thou hast the words of eternal life .

now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people , he entered into capernaum .
two women shall be grinding together ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
and he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass .
i beseech thee for my son onesimus , whom i have begotten in my bonds .
and not for that nation only , but that also he should gather together in one the children of god that were scattered abroad .
and they did all eat , and were filled .
and , behold , they brought to him a man sick of the palsy , lying on a bed : and jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy ; son , be of good cheer ; thy sins be forgiven thee .
be not ye therefore partakers with them .
and he called his ten servants , and delivered them ten pounds , and said unto them , occupy till i come .
this man was taken of the jews , and should have been killed of them : then came i with an army , and rescued him , having understood that he was a roman .
who shall not receive manifold more in this present time , and in the world to come life everlasting .
ye are of your father the devil , and the lusts of your father ye will do . he was a murderer from the beginning , and abode not in the truth , because there is no truth in him . when he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his own : for he is a liar , and the father of it .
his brethren therefore said unto him , depart hence , and go into judaea , that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest .
but if it be of god , ye cannot overthrow it ; lest haply ye be found even to fight against god .
when they which were about him saw what would follow , they said unto him , lord , shall we smite with the sword ?
for when the gentiles , which have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , these , having not the law , are a law unto themselves .
and when they had gone through the isle unto paphos , they found a certain sorcerer , a false prophet , a jew , whose name was bar - jesus .
and some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sprung up , it withered away , because it lacked moisture .
then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples .
saying , father , if thou be willing , remove this cup from me : nevertheless not my will , but thine , be done .
which thing i also did in jerusalem : and many of the saints did i shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief priests ; and when they were put to death , i gave my voice against them .
have we not power to eat and to drink ?
and he spake that saying openly . and peter took him , and began to rebuke him .
by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament .
if we believe not , yet he abideth faithful : he cannot deny himself .
that it may be well with thee , and thou mayest live long on the earth .
then when lust hath conceived , it bringeth forth sin : and sin , when it is finished , bringeth forth death .
for whom he did foreknow , he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son , that he might be the firstborn among many brethren .
and when i was present with you , and wanted , i was chargeable to no man : for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from macedonia supplied : and in all things i have kept myself from being burdensome unto you , and so will i keep myself .
for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john , and bound him in prison for herodias ' sake , his brother philip ' s wife : for he had married her .
now the spirit speaketh expressly , that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith , giving heed to seducing spirits , and doctrines of devils .
forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things , as silver and gold , from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers .
he is not the god of the dead , but the god of the living : ye therefore do greatly err .
remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from the dead according to my gospel .
the world cannot hate you ; but me it hateth , because i testify of it , that the works thereof are evil .
and i fell unto the ground , and heard a voice saying unto me , saul , saul , why persecutest thou me ?
for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith : as it is written , the just shall live by faith .
for he testifieth , thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec .
for the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles through you , as it is written .
howbeit when he , the spirit of truth , is come , he will guide you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear , that shall he speak : and he will shew you things to come .
being forty days tempted of the devil . and in those days he did eat nothing : and when they were ended , he afterward hungered .
then came she and worshipped him , saying , lord , help me .
and as i began to speak , the holy ghost fell on them , as on us at the beginning .
and when he had sent them away , he departed into a mountain to pray .
for our rejoicing is this , the testimony of our conscience , that in simplicity and godly sincerity , not with fleshly wisdom , but by the grace of god , we have had our conversation in the world , and more abundantly to you - ward .
but they said , not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar among the people .
the people therefore that was with him when he called lazarus out of his grave , and raised him from the dead , bare record .
but they cried out , away with him , away with him , crucify him . pilate saith unto them , shall i crucify your king ? the chief priests answered , we have no king but caesar .
and as john fulfilled his course , he said , whom think ye that i am ? i am not he . but , behold , there cometh one after me , whose shoes of his feet i am not worthy to loose .
no man can come to me , except the father which hath sent me draw him : and i will raise him up at the last day .
and as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him . and jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .
then spake jesus to the multitude , and to his disciples .
saying , this fellow persuadeth men to worship god contrary to the law .
jesus said unto him , verily i say unto thee , that this night , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
and then shall many be offended , and shall betray one another , and shall hate one another .
who is he that condemneth ? it is christ that died , yea rather , that is risen again , who is even at the right hand of god , who also maketh intercession for us .
and there sat a certain man at lystra , impotent in his feet , being a cripple from his mother ' s womb , who never had walked .
which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature ?
howbeit that was not first which is spiritual , but that which is natural ; and afterward that which is spiritual .
crying out , men of israel , help : this is the man , that teacheth all men every where against the people , and the law , and this place : and further brought greeks also into the temple , and hath polluted this holy place .
but when jacob heard that there was corn in egypt , he sent out our fathers first .
remember lot ' s wife .
choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god , than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season .
but when they saw him walking upon the sea , they supposed it had been a spirit , and cried out .
salute one another with an holy kiss . the churches of christ salute you .
preach the word ; be instant in season , out of season ; reprove , rebuke , exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine .
now as touching things offered unto idols , we know that we all have knowledge . knowledge puffeth up , but charity edifieth .
that ye would walk worthy of god , who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory .
having a good conscience ; that , whereas they speak evil of you , as of evildoers , they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in christ .
as long as i am in the world , i am the light of the world .
then again the pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight . he said unto them , he put clay upon mine eyes , and i washed , and do see .
for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john .
and he said unto me , my grace is sufficient for thee : for my strength is made perfect in weakness . most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities , that the power of christ may rest upon me .
and he said unto them , ye are they which justify yourselves before men ; but god knoweth your hearts : for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of god .
for if i build again the things which i destroyed , i make myself a transgressor .
for he was yet in the loins of his father , when melchisedec met him .
and the times of this ignorance god winked at ; but now commandeth all men every where to repent .
but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter , neither on the sabbath day .
afterward jesus findeth him in the temple , and said unto him , behold , thou art made whole : sin no more , lest a worse thing come unto thee .
now is my soul troubled ; and what shall i say ? father , save me from this hour : but for this cause came i unto this hour .
for i think that god hath set forth us the apostles last , as it were appointed to death : for we are made a spectacle unto the world , and to angels , and to men .
who died for us , that , whether we wake or sleep , we should live together with him .
but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to his baptism , he said unto them , o generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
in his humiliation his judgment was taken away : and who shall declare his generation ? for his life is taken from the earth .
these things understood not his disciples at the first : but when jesus was glorified , then remembered they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things unto him .
now when all the people were baptized , it came to pass , that jesus also being baptized , and praying , the heaven was opened .
but jesus said unto them , ye know not what ye ask : can ye drink of the cup that i drink of ? and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with ?
where is boasting then ? it is excluded . by what law ? of works ? nay : but by the law of faith .
who against hope believed in hope , that he might become the father of many nations , according to that which was spoken , so shall thy seed be .
the word which god sent unto the children of israel , preaching peace by jesus christ : ( he is lord of all : )
and some of the pharisees which were with him heard these words , and said unto him , are we blind also ?
know ye not , that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death ?
and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and very heavy .
and herein i give my advice : for this is expedient for you , who have begun before , not only to do , but also to be forward a year ago .
then said the jews unto him , thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen abraham ?
and whosoever will not receive you , when ye go out of that city , shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them .
so speak ye , and so do , as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty .
thou wilt say then , the branches were broken off , that i might be graffed in .
wherefore , beloved , seeing that ye look for such things , be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace , without spot , and blameless .
so jesus came again into cana of galilee , where he made the water wine . and there was a certain nobleman , whose son was sick at capernaum .
now concerning spiritual gifts , brethren , i would not have you ignorant .
while the pharisees were gathered together , jesus asked them .
who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things , as moses was admonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle : for , see , saith he , that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount .
jesus saith to him , he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet , but is clean every whit : and ye are clean , but not all .
and if the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it : but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you .
if any man speak , let him speak as the oracles of god ; if any man minister , let him do it as of the ability which god giveth : that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ , to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever . amen .
and when we had accomplished those days , we departed and went our way ; and they all brought us on our way , with wives and children , till we were out of the city : and we kneeled down on the shore , and prayed .
in like manner also , that women adorn themselves in modest apparel , with shamefacedness and sobriety ; not with broided hair , or gold , or pearls , or costly array .
and he said , this will i do : i will pull down my barns , and build greater ; and there will i bestow all my fruits and my goods .
watch ye therefore , and pray always , that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass , and to stand before the son of man .
and all the people that heard him , and the publicans , justified god , being baptized with the baptism of john .
these things said he : and after that he saith unto them , our friend lazarus sleepeth ; but i go , that i may awake him out of sleep .
they say unto him , he will miserably destroy those wicked men , and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen , which shall render him the fruits in their seasons .
he went away again the second time , and prayed , saying , o my father , if this cup may not pass away from me , except i drink it , thy will be done .
therefore , brethren , we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith .
and he said unto them , when ye pray , say , our father which art in heaven , hallowed be thy name . thy kingdom come . thy will be done , as in heaven , so in earth .
and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple , and departed , and went and hanged himself .
but i know him : for i am from him , and he hath sent me .
and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
